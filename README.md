# Motivation and problem statement:
**Why are you planning to do this analysis?** 
    * I am planning on comparing the amount of black people who live in Kentucky to the level of education they have achieved (highschool, bs, or higher) I then want to compare this to where people went to school or the demographics of schools in different areas. There are a lot of private schools in KY but I am still undecided and unsure where the data will take me. Thinking of potentially looking into jobs or comparing rates across racial or sex demographics... might compare kentucky education and race demographics to washingtons demographics! I think this could be interesting becuase of how different these places are viewed not just location, but income, culture, and racial demographics. I have a feeling they will have similar black education stats to Kentucky.
**Why is it potentially interesting and useful, from a scientific, practical, and/or human-centered perspective?**
    * This is an area of interest and passion for me especially as someone who identifies as a black Kentuckian. I also think it gives a more human-centered perspective into education access and then careers of consistent access to 'medium' to 'high' income in the state.
**What do you hope to learn?** 
    * I want to shed light on the education system in Kentucky and who it is failing or succeeding for (why are we ranked 45th in the nation?). A lot of schools in the bigger cities are private and cost a lot of money but their demographics are mostly non-BIPOC people. How does this impact the level of education people achives if they go to these schools or not and the barriers in place to attend these places? I think it could be interesting to show the comparison of washington and kentucky education, especially since I feel the demographics of both areas are pretty similar in some aspect and totally different in others

# Data selected for analysis:
**What dataset do you plan to use, and why?** 
    * Governmental data of public schools in Kentucky as well as census data to get a more robust understanding of kentucky demographics in the scope of education and access
**Summarize what is represented in the dataset**
    *  KY public education data: Basic statistical information about Kentucky's schools, including number of schools, number of teachers and students, statewide education funding and other items. Kentucky's public school system is directed by state statutes and regulations. All numbers listed are for the 2019-2020 school year unless otherwise noted.
    washington & kentucky Census data: Population, age and sex, race, population characteristics, housing, familiy & living arrangements, computer & internet use, education, health, economy, tranportation, income & poverty, businesses, geography

**Explain why this dataset is a suitable one for addressing your research goal listed above**
    * I think combining my findings from the census data and the kentcuky education data will be able to give me clear comparison and analysis of black kentuckians access to education or level of education in KY which is ranked 38th compared to black washingtonians (wa is ranked 4th in education) I think The census data for both states will be very simialr statistics for black people. It also is one of the only public data sources i could find on black education rates in these states
**Highlight any possible ethical considerations to using this dataset**
    * How is data collected? Is everyone being included/accounted for, other barriers to acces to education being considered, census data from 2020

# Unknowns and dependencies:
Are there any factors outside of your control that might impact your ability to complete this project by the end of the quarter? 
    * maybe lack of 'good' data or deadlines for other classes/work
