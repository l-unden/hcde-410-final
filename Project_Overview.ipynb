    "# _Kentucky High School Graduation Rates Compared to State Educational Funding per County_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a proud Kentuckian, born and raised for eighteen years of my life, Kentucky holds a strong spot in my heart. I really am passionate about the state, its people, and all the beauty it has to offer to the world. That being said, Kentucky is ranked 47th in Bachelor Degrees. Even though in the past decade Kentucky’s educational and economic status has improved, from 2009-2013 only 22% of Kentuckians hold a Bachelor’s degree. However, 83% of Kentuckians do have a high school diploma. What is causing this drop off?\n",
    "\n",
    "For my final project I want to discover if state funding per county impacts the rates of high school graduation. I wanted to look into higher education but there was little to no public data on college graduation rates. This is because colleges are open to anyone - you don't have to be from Kentucky or even live there to get a BS degree. This would skew my data and have inconclusive results. Therefore, I decided to focus on High School Funding and graduation rates in Kentucky from 2018-2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background or Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a study done in 2015 by the University of Kentucky's research team named Community and Economic Development Intiative of Kentucky (CEDIK)called [Education: Where does Kentucky rank & why does it matter?](https://cedikentucky.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/education-where-does-kentucky-rank-why-does-it-matter/)\n",
    "Here, Research Associate Simona Balazs looked into visualizing the potential link between education level and income. It is important to note that 'a county's education level is \\[not\\] the only factor imapcting per captita income' but wants to reveal or suggest that higher education attainment means increased income.\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought the visualizations in this study where very helpful for understanding my data, where I want to take my project, and what my findings will mean. The study was explained and visualized great as well as had a clear reference section.\n",

    "## Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the rate of highschool graduates per county in Kentucky compared to the amount of public funding granted to each county?\n",
    "- Do counties with less students get less funding? Vise versa?\n",
    "- Do counties with less funding have lower high school graduation rates?\n",
    "- What is the criteria for funding amounts?\n",
    "- How much educational funding does Kentucky get as a state?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "_Kentucky counties with higher amounts of educational funding have higher rates of high school graduates compared to counties with less funding._\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data \n",
    "\n",
    "All data found and downloaded from [Kentucky Department of Education](https://education.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx)\n",
    "\n",
    "[2018-2019 Kentucky District Funding for Schools per County](KY_18-19_District_State_Grant.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "[2018-2019 Kentucky High School Graduation Rates](KY_GRADUATION_RATE.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "[2018-2019 Kentucky School Funding by County per Student](KY_18-19_SPENDING_PER_STUDENT.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, using data on the graduation rates of all Kenucky public schools, I combined the numbers of graduates who took either four years ('GRAD4YRS) or five years ('GRADS5YR') together (curr_grad) and the orginal cohort size of the graduating class ('COHORT4YRS') and ('COHORT5YRS') together (curr_cohort) in a list of dictionaries where ever dictionary is a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using jupyter notebook I created a decitionary that stored the county name as a key and another dictionary to hold 'grad_rate' which I found by dividing curr_grad by curr_cohort find the percent of that county that graduating in the 2018-2019 Kentucky school year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, after cleaning the funding_per_student dataset to have two columns - county name and funding per student, I imported the .csv file into jupyter. From here I iterated through the list of dictionaries to find matching county data from graduation rate with corresponding funding rates. This created a dictionary of dictionaries called stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stats contains a county name key and its corresponding graduation rate ('grad_rate') and funding amount ('funding'). Labeling stats three value headers: 'county', 'graduation_rate', 'school_county_funding', I exported into a csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Excel I graphed the data into the three graphs found in the **Findings section.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "![*Funding per Student vs High School Graduation Rate by Kentucky County in 2018-2019](Images/funding_grad_rate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Funding per student had little to no impact on the rates of high school graduates by county in the 2018-2019 school year. This disproves my hypothesis that more funding a school recived, the higher their rates of graduation are. Overall, the results are inconclusive. It dioesnt support or disprove that there is a correleation between the two. Both high funded and low funded schools have similar graduation rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The scatter plot starts at a 60% graduation rate instead of 0% to visualaize the data more clearly\n",
    "\n",
    "![Histogram of High School Graduation Rates by Kentucky County 2018-2019](Images/county_grad_rate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A majority of counties in Kentucky have graduation rates above 83.3%\n",
    "\n",
    "![Funding per High School Student by Kentucky County in 2018-2019](Images/county_funding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Around 80% of Kentucky public schools recieve between $12,251 and $18,251 per student.\n",
    "\n",
    "Highest: 33% of school funding per student between $12,251 and $14,251\n",
    "2nd Highest: 27% of school funding per student between $14,251 and $16,251\n",
    "3rd Highest: 19.2% of school funding per student between $16,251 and $18,251\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "Data for Kentucky county funding only had separation from Preschool and School. I am assuming school meant K-12. I was unable to pull just high school funding per county. This skewed my results but still represented totally education system funidng for the county so results can still draw some conclusion. If I were to go deeper into this project, I would try to separate different levels of schooling funding. I would also look into different demographics like race and income of each county and pull conclusions from there.\n",
