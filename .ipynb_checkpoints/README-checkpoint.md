# _Kentucky High School Graduation Rates Compared to State Educational Funding per County_

## Introduction

Being a proud Kentuckian, born and raised for eighteen years of my life, Kentucky holds a strong spot in my heart. I really am passionate about the state, its people, and all the beauty it has to offer to the world. That being said, Kentucky is ranked 47th in Bachelor Degrees. Even though in the past decade Kentucky’s educational and economic status has improved, from 2009-2013 only 22% of Kentuckians hold a Bachelor’s degree. However, 83% of Kentuckians do have a high school diploma. What is causing this drop off?

For my final project I want to discover if state funding per county impacts the rates of high school graduation. I wanted to look into higher education but there was little to no public data on college graduation rates. This is because colleges are open to anyone - you don't have to be from Kentucky or even live there to get a BS degree. This would skew my data and have inconclusive results. Therefore, I decided to focus on High School Funding and graduation rates in Kentucky from 2018-2019.
